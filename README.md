## Cloud computing characteristics
*Idea with cloud computing* – have a metered self-provisioned way to access IT services over a network
### 5 main cloud computing characteristics
1. Resource pooling – 
- Cloud service provider (CSP) has equipment available for cloud tenants (us)
- Some resources of a cloud are – compute, network, storage, etc.
- Resource pooling means that all these resources appear to be infinite to the cloud tenant
2. Broad access – 
- We can use a wide array of devices to access a cloud service
- Cloud service – Some kind of IT service available on cloud
3. Rapid Elasticity –
- We as tenants have the ability to add or remove IT services running in the cloud.
- This allows us to scale.
- Eg:- Adding or removing storage as needed, Adding/Removing VMs, resizing VMs, autoscaling
4. On-demand self-service –
- Cloud user can deploy & manage resources by themselves. The CSP technicians don’t have to get involved.
- This provides us with control to provision & de-provision resources by ourselves.
5. Metered Usage –
- Our usage of power-based resources, etc. are tracked & we pay for what we use.
